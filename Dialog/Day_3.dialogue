Demi: [#demi=Annoyed]...
Gigi: [#gigi=Default]What's wrong?
Demi: [#demi=Shocked]Huh?
Gigi: [#gigi=Default]You didn’t say anything and stared at me for 1 hour 23 minutes and 21 seconds.
Demi: [#demi=Default]Ah, I was just thinking about something. Don’t mind me.
Gigi: [#gigi=Default]If you don’t tell me what you’re thinking, I will read your mind.
Demi: [#demi=Shocked]YOU CAN DO THAT!?
Gigi: [#gigi=Grin]*giggles* No, I wish, you look so cute when you’re deep in thought. 
Gigi: [#gigi=Default]But seriously, spill the beans.
. . .
Gigi: [#gigi=Default]So that’s why you’re so tired.
Demi: [#demi=Annoyed]...
Gigi: [#gigi=Default]Do you think it’s because of the pills?
Demi: [#demi=Default]Maybe? Give me a second, I’ll call the doctor.
Demi calls the doctor, but the call goes to voice mail.
Demi: [#demi=Annoyed]Damn, he’s not picking up. Guess we should try tomorrow.

Demi: [#demi=Default](Huh? A delivery receipt? I didn’t mail anything out today.)
Demi: [#demi=Shocked](Wait, the content says, “Gigi”!? She mailed herself?)
Demi: [#demi=Shocked](This is bad, I gotta cancel the delivery!)

Demi: [#demi=Default](Shoot, what’s her password again? C’mon think!) 
Demi: [#demi=Default](Wait, Gigi doesn’t remember passwords, she writes them down on a piece of paper.) 
Demi: [#demi=Default](Gigi always checks her social media on the couch.)
